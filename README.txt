The Android TV App for Homey is the ultimate tool for those who want to take full control of their TV experience.

Easily control your TV, just like you would from the Google TV app on your phone. With this app, you can send various commands to your TV such as on/off, D-pad up/down, media play, media next, back, confirm, home, and even set input to HDMI 1.

To use this app, you need to connect your Android device to your Homey. Because this requires a local connection to your TV it needs a Homey Pro to function properly. Please note that this app is not an official app and is not affiliated with Android or Google. Use at your own risk.
